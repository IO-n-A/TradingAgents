# Future Live Trading Deployment

This directory is a placeholder for future work related to deploying the FinAI_algo models for live trading.

## Considerations for Live Trading:

1.  **Brokerage API Integration:**
    *   Secure and robust integration with a brokerage API (e.g., Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, etc.) for order execution and account management.
    *   Handling API rate limits, error responses, and connection issues.

2.  **Real-time Data Feeds:**
    *   Subscription to reliable real-time market data feeds for prices, volumes, and news.
    *   Low-latency data ingestion and processing.

3.  **Sentiment Analysis Pipeline:**
    *   Real-time news fetching and sentiment analysis pipeline.
    *   Ensuring the sentiment model can process incoming news quickly enough to inform trading decisions.

4.  **RL Agent Inference:**
    *   Efficient loading and inference of the trained RL agent.
    *   State management for the RL agent based on live market conditions.

5.  **Order Management System (OMS):**
    *   Logic for placing, monitoring, and managing orders (market, limit, stop-loss, take-profit).
    *   Handling partial fills, order rejections, and cancellations.

6.  **Risk Management:**
    *   Pre-defined risk limits (e.g., maximum drawdown, position sizing, daily loss limits).
    *   Automated kill-switches or alerts if risk limits are breached.

7.  **Infrastructure & Scalability:**
    *   Deployment on a reliable server or cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
    *   Ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.
    *   Scalability to handle increased data volume or trading frequency.

8.  **Monitoring & Alerting:**
    *   Comprehensive real-time monitoring of system health, model performance, trading activity, and P&L.
    *   Automated alerts for critical issues (e.g., system failures, large losses, API errors).

9.  **Security:**
    *   Secure storage of API keys and sensitive credentials.
    *   Protection against unauthorized access and cyber threats.

10. **Compliance & Regulations:**
    *   Adherence to relevant financial regulations and compliance requirements.

11. **Backtesting Rigor:**
    *   Ensuring that the live trading strategy closely mirrors the conditions and assumptions of the backtesting environment to build confidence in its viability. Differences in data feeds, latency, and order execution can significantly impact performance.

## Development Steps (High-Level):

1.  **Select Brokerage & Data Provider:** Choose services that meet the project's technical and financial requirements.
2.  **Develop Brokerage Connector:** Implement robust API integration.
3.  **Develop Real-time Data Ingestion:** Set up data pipelines for market and news data.
4.  **Adapt Trading Logic:** Modify existing paper trading scripts for live execution.
5.  **Implement OMS & Risk Management:** Build core trading and safety features.
6.  **Set Up Production Infrastructure:** Deploy to a chosen server/cloud environment.
7.  **Implement Comprehensive Monitoring:** Integrate logging, metrics, and alerting.
8.  **Thorough Testing:** Conduct extensive testing in a simulated live environment before committing real capital.
