# Environment Configurations README

This directory holds configuration files for the FinRL trading environments.
These files define parameters such as initial capital, transaction costs, state space definitions,
action space configurations, reward functions (if configurable), and other settings
that characterize the simulation environment in which RL agents are trained and evaluated.
