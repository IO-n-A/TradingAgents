# MLOps Monitoring Alerts

This directory contains configurations related to alerting for the MLOps system. Alerts are crucial for proactively identifying and responding to issues within the data pipelines, model training processes, model performance, and deployment infrastructure.

The primary mechanism for alerting described here is based on **Prometheus** for metrics collection and **Alertmanager** for handling and dispatching alerts.

## Files

*   **`alertmanager_rules.yaml`**:
    *   This file defines the alerting rules for Alertmanager.
    *   Rules are typically written in Prometheus's alerting rule format.
    *   Each rule specifies:
        *   `alert`: A unique name for the alert.
        *   `expr`: A PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) expression that, if it evaluates to true for a certain duration, triggers the alert. This expression is based on metrics exposed by your MLOps components.
        *   `for`: The duration the expression must be true before the alert becomes active.
        *   `labels`: Additional labels to attach to the alert (e.g., severity, service).
        *   `annotations`: More detailed information about the alert, often including a summary and description, which can use templating to include values from the alert's labels.
    *   Examples of alerts defined in this file might include:
        *   Data ingestion pipeline failures.
        *   Stale data (no new data ingested for a prolonged period).
        *   Feature engineering pipeline failures.
        *   Model training pipeline failures.
        *   Significant drops in model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, Sharpe ratio below a threshold).
        *   High error rates in pipeline components.
        *   Failures in deployment services (e.g., paper trading bot down).

## Alerting Workflow

1.  **Metrics Exposure:**
    *   MLOps pipeline scripts (data ingestion, feature engineering, training, deployment) and services must expose relevant metrics. This is typically done using a Prometheus client library (e.g., `prometheus_client` for Python).
    *   Metrics can include:
        *   Pipeline job success/failure status (`pipeline_job_success_status`).
        *   Timestamp of last successful operation (`pipeline_last_successful_ingestion_timestamp_seconds`).
        *   Model performance metrics from evaluation/backtesting (`sentiment_model_validation_accuracy`, `rl_agent_backtest_sharpe_ratio`).
        *   Error counts or rates (`pipeline_component_errors_total`).
        *   Service health/uptime (`up` metric for deployed services).

2.  **Prometheus Scraping:**
    *   A Prometheus server is configured to scrape these exposed metrics from your MLOps components at regular intervals.

3.  **Rule Evaluation:**
    *   Prometheus continuously evaluates the alerting rules defined in `alertmanager_rules.yaml` (or a similar file loaded by Prometheus).

4.  **Alert Firing:**
    *   If a rule's expression is true for the specified `for` duration, Prometheus fires an alert to Alertmanager.

5.  **Alertmanager Processing:**
    *   Alertmanager receives alerts from Prometheus.
    *   It de-duplicates, groups, and routes alerts to configured receivers based on matching labels.
    *   Alertmanager can also silence alerts or inhibit alerts based on other active alerts.

6.  **Notification:**
    *   Configured receivers in Alertmanager (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, custom webhooks) send out notifications to the relevant teams or individuals.

## Setup (High-Level)

1.  **Instrument MLOps Components:** Add code to your Python scripts and services to expose metrics using a Prometheus client.
2.  **Deploy Prometheus:** Set up a Prometheus server. Configure its `prometheus.yml` to scrape metrics from your MLOps components. Load alerting rules (like `alertmanager_rules.yaml`) into Prometheus.
3.  **Deploy Alertmanager:** Set up an Alertmanager instance. Configure its `alertmanager.yml` to define notification routes, receivers (e.g., email, Slack), and grouping/inhibition rules. Point Prometheus to this Alertmanager instance.

## Considerations

*   **Actionable Alerts:** Ensure alerts are meaningful and actionable. Avoid overly noisy alerts that lead to alert fatigue.
*   **Thresholds:** Carefully choose thresholds for metric-based alerts. These may need tuning over time.
*   **Metric Naming:** Use a consistent and clear naming convention for metrics.
*   **Documentation:** Document each alert: what it means, why it might fire, and initial steps for investigation.

This alerting setup aims to provide timely notifications about critical issues, enabling quicker response and resolution, thereby improving the reliability and robustness of the FinAI_algo MLOps system.
