# MLOps Tests

This directory contains all tests related to the MLOps pipelines and components for the FinAI_algo project. Testing is crucial to ensure the reliability, correctness, and robustness of the MLOps system.

## Objectives of Testing in MLOps

*   **Ensure Correctness:** Verify that data processing, feature engineering, model training, and inference logic behave as expected.
*   **Maintain Reliability:** Catch regressions or issues introduced by code changes or changes in data/dependencies.
*   **Validate Data Quality:** Check for issues in raw or processed data (though some of this might also be covered by monitoring scripts or data validation tools like Great Expectations).
*   **Verify Pipeline Integrity:** Ensure that pipelines run end-to-end and that components integrate correctly.
*   **Build Confidence:** Provide assurance that the MLOps system is functioning correctly before deploying models or relying on pipeline outputs.

## Subdirectories

*   **`pipeline_tests/`**: Contains unit and integration tests for individual MLOps pipeline components.
    *   Examples:
        *   Testing data transformation functions in `build_features.py`.
        *   Testing data fetching logic in `data_ingestion_pipeline.py` (e.g., with mock APIs).
        *   Verifying the output schema of different pipeline stages.
*   **`integration_tests/`**: Contains tests that verify the integration between multiple pipeline components or end-to-end pipeline runs with sample data.
    *   Example: Running a mini-workflow from data ingestion through feature engineering to model training with a small, controlled dataset to ensure all parts connect and produce expected intermediate artifacts.
*   **(Future) `model_tests/`**: Could contain tests specifically for validating trained models beyond standard evaluation metrics.
    *   Examples:
        *   Behavioral testing (e.g., using CheckList for NLP models).
        *   Robustness tests (e.g., performance on perturbed inputs).
        *   Fairness and bias tests.
*   **(Future) `infrastructure_tests/`**: For testing the MLOps infrastructure itself (e.g., if using Kubernetes, Airflow, MLflow server setups, test their configurations or accessibility).

## Testing Frameworks

*   **`pytest`**: A mature and widely used Python testing framework, recommended for its simplicity, flexibility, and rich plugin ecosystem.
*   **`unittest`**: Python's built-in testing framework.
*   Specialized libraries for data testing (e.g., `Great Expectations` for data validation, `pandera` for DataFrame schema validation) can be integrated.

## Running Tests

Tests can be run using the chosen framework's command-line interface. For `pytest`:

```bash
# Run all tests in the MLOps/tests directory and subdirectories
pytest MLOps/tests/

# Run tests in a specific file
pytest MLOps/tests/pipeline_tests/test_data_ingestion.py

# Run a specific test function
pytest MLOps/tests/pipeline_tests/test_data_ingestion.py::test_fetch_financial_data_mocked
```

## Test Coverage

Aim for good test coverage, especially for critical components and complex logic. Tools like `pytest-cov` can help measure test coverage.

## CI/CD Integration

Automated tests should be integrated into a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins). This ensures that tests are run automatically on every code change, helping to catch issues early.

This testing structure aims to build a reliable and maintainable MLOps system for the FinAI_algo project.
