# MLOps Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for various MLOps-related tasks that benefit from an interactive, exploratory environment. These notebooks are typically used for:

*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Deep dives into raw data, processed features, or model outputs to understand their characteristics, identify anomalies, or debug issues.
*   **Prototyping:** Quickly testing out ideas for data processing, feature engineering, model evaluation, or monitoring logic before formalizing them into scripts.
*   **Debugging:** Interactively investigating problems encountered in automated pipelines or model performance.
*   **Reporting & Visualization:** Creating ad-hoc reports or visualizations that might be more detailed or customized than what's available in automated dashboards.

## Files

*   **`data_exploration_mlops.ipynb`**:
    *   A general-purpose notebook for EDA related to MLOps.
    *   **Contents (Placeholder Structure):**
        *   Setup and imports (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.).
        *   Functions to load data (raw, processed, model outputs, DVC-tracked data).
        *   Sections for common EDA tasks:
            *   Summary statistics.
            *   Distribution plots.
            *   Time series analysis.
            *   Correlation analysis.
            *   Missing value checks.
        *   Specific sections for MLOps investigations:
            *   Deeper analysis of data drift (complementing `MLOps/monitoring/scripts/check_data_drift.py`).
            *   Analysis of model prediction errors or biases.
            *   Exploration of specific data segments causing issues.
    *   This notebook serves as a template or starting point for various data explorations. Users can duplicate and modify it for specific tasks.

*   **(Future Notebooks - Examples)**
    *   `sentiment_model_evaluation_details.ipynb`: For detailed analysis of sentiment model predictions, error analysis on specific text samples, and comparison of different fine-tuning approaches.
    *   `rl_agent_behavior_analysis.ipynb`: To visualize RL agent actions in specific market scenarios, analyze reward components, or debug environment interactions.
    *   `pipeline_debug_notebook.ipynb`: A notebook used to step through parts of an MLOps pipeline interactively if issues arise.

## Best Practices for Using Notebooks in MLOps

*   **Version Control:** Commit notebooks to Git, but be mindful of large output cells. Consider clearing outputs before committing or using tools like `nbstripout`.
*   **Environment Consistency:** Use a consistent Python environment (e.g., defined by `requirements.txt` or a Conda environment) for notebooks to ensure reproducibility.
*   **Parameterization:** For notebooks that perform recurring analyses, consider using tools like Papermill to parameterize and execute them programmatically.
*   **Clarity and Documentation:** Write clear markdown cells to explain the purpose of code blocks, analyses, and conclusions. Make notebooks understandable to others (and your future self).
*   **From Notebook to Script:** If an analysis or piece of logic in a notebook becomes a standard, recurring task, refactor it into a Python script (e.g., in `MLOps/monitoring/scripts/` or `MLOps/pipelines/`) for better automation, testing, and maintainability. Notebooks are excellent for exploration, but scripts are generally better for production MLOps workflows.
*   **Data Access:** Ensure notebooks have a clear and secure way to access necessary data, whether it's from local files, DVC, databases, or cloud storage. Avoid hardcoding sensitive credentials.

These notebooks provide a flexible and powerful environment for the human-in-the-loop aspects of MLOps, complementing the automated scripts and pipelines.
